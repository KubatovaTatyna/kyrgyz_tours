      together two main reasons to pull you out of your home, bottomless powder and cultural experience.

      Seamless trip begins from capital city of Kyrgyzstan, Bishkek and stretches to the IssykKul province. The first
      thing you get faced with, is the golden eagles, taigans (Kyrgyz hunting dogs) and their masters on training. One
      of
      the most impressive style of hunting with involving the predators still existing in Tien-Shan fields.

      Through six - seven hours driving with some food and Eagle performance stops on the way you will found yourself in
      very eastern part of the Kyrgyzstan where by the time we will wait you with a ready tea\coffee behind the safety
      briefing for future venture.

      Next three skitouring days will based from our winter glamping base camp where you will be provided with a
      traditional Kyrgyz handcrafted Yurt stay. Winterized yurt lodge features wood/coal fired stove, solar lightings,
      native style rugs and throws on top of a extremely soft floor beds, isolated wooden floor, game tables and
      washstands in each yurt.
      Dinners and breakfasts are family style, served in the separate dining/kitchen Yurt for all together, no
      self-cateringю Сhefs dishes are mostly from a local cuisine and you will probably love it if you are not vegan.
      The
      lunches are nicely packed for the field.

      The intertwined terrain above our camp is comparably, more alpine aspected. Gives option for long touring days
      with
      a killer views in the blue bird days, ridge walks which ends skiing down all the way to the basecamp. For being
      independent from the weather the home slopes are features mellower inclines with an hectares variety of open
      tree
      glades.

      After epic yurt camping experience itinerary leads up to the next valley, into the famous Jyrgalan district.
      Trough
      solid mostly touring day with crossing 3465m height pass you will appear down in this small settlement which was
      founded by Soviet government as a coal mine back in 1936.

      Here our guests are will be provided with a finite skiers lodge at the upper edge of the village with warm, cosy
      house where is two (bed) rooms, one loby (library) room,. Two separate (with hot and cold running water)
      bathrooms.
      One traditional felt covered Yurt (optional sleeping area). One dining Yurt. Two outdoor terraces. Fire pit.
      Massive
      backyard for sunset skiing and lots of midnight stars for another three full ski days.

      This exceptional spot gives immediate access to the fall line of Kyrgyz five star off-piste skiing in all
      direction
      right from the front door of the house. Local bottomless powder blanketing rows of epic steep ranges, mellow
      glides
      and wide open bowls offering 400 to 1000 meters of vertical drops every run.
